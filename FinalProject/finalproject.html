    About Our Horses
  </center>
  </h2>
  <h4>Arabians</h4>
  <p>
    Arabians are known to be one of the purest and oldest horse breeds. They
    originate in Arabia. This Horse breed is hearty and can handle the sand
    from the desert and hot summer temperatures. The temperment of the Arabian
    can be very energetic and high-strung. They require Experienced Riders and
    are known to be very agile. Arabians have good endurance and speed making
    them champions in  a wide range of competitions.
  </p>
  <h4>Akhal-Teke</h4>
  <p>
    The National Horse of Turkmanistan is the Akhal-Teke (pronounced: ahK-hail
    TeK-eh). This horse Breed is as ancient as the Arabian and also just as pure,
    being one of the first horse breeds to ever exist. People in Turkmanistan
    love their horses dearly and treat them better than family. This is easy to
    see why when you see the shiny metallic coat of this horse. The Akhal-Teke
    is very rare and these horses are traditionally given to royalty or important
    people from the Turkman people. Buying one of these horses purebred is challenging
    but fortunately we are able to provide you with some of the best.
  </p>
  <h4>Friesian</h4>
  <p>
    Friesians are very large Horses known for their long wavy manes and tails. They
    traditionally come in all black but can rarely be seen in another color. Friesians
    have feathering on their lower legs just above the hooves. This breed is intelligent
    and gentle which makes them great at dressage and also very magestic.
  </p>
  <h4>Miniature Horse</h4>
  <p>
    As the name suggests the miniature horse is a very small version of a horse.
    They make great companions and are good in shows. Some people train them to
    be seeing eye pets for the blind and can even be trained to use a toilet which
    makes them very intelligent and highly trainable.
